# html-notes

This is just a simple HTML note helper, designed for folks learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables you to take notes **in** HTML/CSS/JS as you learn, in order to help retain that information.

## Requirements

This tool requires that Node JS is installed. You can install it from their homepage [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

It also is mostly focused toward users of VS Code. It is not a requirement, but you can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you'd like.

Finally, very basic terminal usage is expected just to run the single script to create new note files.
